Ran into *lots* of memory problems using this on the Pico W. MicroPython just isn't reliable. Archiving repo.


This is my attempt at creating an Over-The-Air (OTA) module for the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

See the module comments for the documentation.

I also discussed the need for this module and my approach [here](https://github.com/gamename/raspberry-pi-pico-w-mailbox-sensor#ota-what-ota).
